Code Style
----------

This is the recommended code style for WYSIYWD.


### Git
 * Do not push merges generated by `git pull`. Always `pull --rebase`.
 * Always check what you are pushing using some graphic tool (`qgit`,
   `gitg`, `gitk`)
 * Keep the commits small and do one and only one thing in each commit.
   Use `rebase -i` and `amend` to rewrite your **local** history and
   keep it clean.
 * Commit log should be something like this (note the empty line between
   the summary and the long description):
   ```
    Summary of the commit

    Long description of the commit wrapped at 72 characters.
    ```
 * Never force-push on the `master` branch unless there is
   a very good reason to do it



Workflow
--------

### Stable branch: `master`

The WYSIWYD project has finished and this repository does typically not receive new features. Bug fixes or new features should be done via pull requests on dedicated branches. The `master` branch is protected and only a limited number of contributors
have write access.
